          JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It
          is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for
          example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of
          its environment to provide programmatic control over them.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>"this is very good language</li>
          <li>"its very fast"</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          avaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date,
          and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators,
          control structures, and statements.
        </p>

        <code> const a = 5; const b = 10; </code>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
        <header>Variables</header>
        <p>
          Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects
          to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example,
          client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an
          HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input,
          and page navigation.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>"variable is used to store data</li>
        </ul>
        <code> if(name === "dara") console.log("hi") </code>
        <p>
          JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally
          different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but
          does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Functions">
        <header>Functions</header>
        <ul>
          <li>"Functions are uses alot"</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by
          declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small
          number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values.
          JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more
          common class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides
          dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for
          individual objects.
        </p>
        <p>
          JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not
          have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. You do not have
          to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or
          protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces.
        </p>
        <code> if(name === "dara") console.log("hi") </code>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="DataTypes">
        <header>DataTypes</header>
        <p>
          Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web
          pages the global object is window, so you can set and access global
          variables using the window.variable syntax
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>"DataTypes are very good to know"</li>
        </ul>
        <code> if(name === "dara") console.log("hi") </code>
        <p>
          Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window
          or frame from another window or frame by specifying the window or
          frame name.
        </p>

      <section class="main-section" id="Reference">
        <header>Reference</header>
        <p>
          To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write
          your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Reference is also good to know.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in
          identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as
          characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are
          Number_hits, temp99, and _name.
        </p>
        <code> if(number === 10) console.log("10") </code>
